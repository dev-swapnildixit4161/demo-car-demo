# Spring Boot Reactive Application for Azure/GCP Cloud Services

This is a sample Spring Boot reactive application that demonstrates how to interact with the cloud services of Azure/GCP to push data into a Pub-Sub system and fetch data from the cloud-managed reactive MongoDB repositories. This application is built using Spring WebFlux, Spring Data Reactive MongoDB, and the respective cloud SDKs for Azure/GCP.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Maven (for building and managing dependencies)
- Azure/GCP Cloud account with appropriate credentials and access to Pub-Sub and Reactive MongoDB services.
- Google SDK setup on local terminal

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/knoldus/java-competency-demo
```
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE or code editor.

3. Configure the Azure/GCP credentials and other necessary configurations in the `application.yml`, `application-cosmos.yml`, `application-firestore.yml` file.

4. Build the application using Maven:
```bash
mvn clean package
```
5. Run the application 
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profile.active=cosmos
```

## Configuration

### Azure config
- cosmosdb.key = <COSMOS_KEY>
- cosmosdb.uri = <COSMOS_URI>
- kafka.bootstrap-servers= ${KAFKA_SERVER}
- kafka.properties.security.protocol = <KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL>
- kafka.properties.sasl.mechanism = <SASL_MECHANISM>
- kafka.properties.sasl.jaas.config = <JASS_CONFIG>
- kafka.producer.key-serializer = <KEY_SERIALIZER>
- kafka.producer.value-serializer = <VALUE_SERIALIZER>

### GCP config
Obtain the JSON Key:
If you don't have the JSON key for your Google Cloud service account, you can generate one from the Google Cloud Console. Navigate to the "IAM & Admin" section and create a new service account. Then, generate and download the JSON key for that service account.

- google.application.credentials  = <GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS>
- google.application.pubSub.topic = <TOPIC-NAME>
- spring.cloud.gcp.project-id = <PROJECT-ID>
